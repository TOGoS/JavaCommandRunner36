Version 36.1.26
JAR: urn:bitprint:H6SX6RXIIIWQ2YFKWBKQIOXVEUXD2DTW.XTA6A7A7ZOQUJ3R25PCLZW3C4TTTRKBPRB35K7A
Date: 2023-11-13
Features:
  - Add http://ns.nuke24.net/JavaCommandRunner36/Action/FindExe, which can be handy,
    especially with `-v`, for determining where your executable files are, or
    why they can't be found.
Changes:
  - If $PATH is null, try $Path, for Windows compatibility.
    This may turn out to be insufficient, as all environment variable
    resolution might be expected to be case-insensitive on Windows.
  - Always include empty string at the beginning of effective PATHEXT so that
    explicitly spelled-out commands (e.g. "myscript.bat") will not fail to resolve.
  - Piping error exit code changed from -1001 to 23.

Version 36.1.24
JAR: urn:bitprint:2KZOTWESFPHVZG72OW6WNROYHZD4BVWB.YDWEYNN6NSM22BJAD2MPH7TXJKER3W3DXKCEH7A
Date: 2023-10-24
Fixes:
  - Calling the program with zero arguments no longer throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
  - `--` argument to `jcr:docmd` has the intended effect of treating the following argument
    literally, i.e. as a command rather than an option or a variable assignment,
    even if it looks like an option or variable assignment
Notes:
  - After this release was made, I rebased the Git history
    since v36.1.20 (8dd564e11df0d55007b9a4076e4ffce4841f0676)
    to include otherwise missing src/test/resources/foo.env.
    v36.1.24 was 8dd564e11df0d55007b9a4076e4ffce4841f0676,
    which corresponds to 778bb24cfdd014cfa1a74cd309ca18bd58127d6c
    in the new history.

Version 36.1.22
JAR: urn:bitprint:MLK2LFV4JQXIIHAZSNHTLX63KWSNMORK.WUNTIMAX7MPHSKIJWPJJDDQJPILO75D5HEUGWZA
Date: 2023-10-24
Features:
  - Add support for `data:` URIs with a type and/or base64 encoding
  - `--clear-env` and `--load-env-from-properties-file=<FILE|URI>` options to `jcr:docmd`
  - Add `jcr:printenv`, which prints all environment variables, one per line
Changes:
  - References in help text to `jcr:run` changed to `jcr:docmd`
Notes:
  - `--load-env-from-properties-file` is very verbose because I want the format of the file
    to be obvious.  That said, I might decide to drop "load" in the future.
    Or maybe not, since it has nice symmetry with `--clear-env`.
